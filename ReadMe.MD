# Testimonials Grid Section

This is the solution for the [Testimonials Grid Section challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7) on Frontend Mentor. The challenge is to build out a testimonials grid section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The design includes a mobile and desktop layout. Users should be able to:

1. View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
2. See hover states for interactive elements
